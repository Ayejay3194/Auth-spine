DECANS USER EXPECTATIONS
=======================

Decans is a system for recognizing patterns.

It does not:
- predict events
- diagnose conditions
- give instructions for living
- replace personal judgment

Astrology here is used as a language to describe tendencies,
contexts, and timing correlations — not as belief or authority.

You remain the decision-maker.
Decans reflects. You choose.

If you want certainty, advice, or validation,
this is not the right tool.
