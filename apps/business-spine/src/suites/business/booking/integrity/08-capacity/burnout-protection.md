CAPACITY + BURNOUT PROTECTION
=============================

Rules engine:
- max bookings/day per provider
- max hours/day
- mandatory breaks (e.g., 30 min after 4 hours)
- buffer times per service
- rolling workload limits (7-day window)

Effects:
- blocks bookings that violate rules
- suggests nearest compliant slots
- flags chronic over-scheduling to admin
