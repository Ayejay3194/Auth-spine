# Start Here – How To Use This Kit

This is not a "read and feel inspired" thing. It's an execution manual.

You will:
1. Set up your environment.
2. Run your starter Next.js project.
3. Follow the 90-day plan.
4. Pick a money lane (job, freelance, templates, SaaS).
5. Use AI properly to ship fast without wrecking your codebase.

## What You Need

- A machine that can run Node.js (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- One starter repo (e.g. a Next.js + Prisma app).
- The Vibe Coding Manual (ideation + pre-code + GLM + Claude).
- Time: 1–3 hours per day.

Read in this order:

1. `setup/01-environment.md`
2. `setup/02-running-nextjs-app.md`
3. `program/01-90-day-plan.md`
4. `program/02-12-month-arc.md`
5. `money/01-money-lanes-overview.md`
6. `workflow/` docs for day-to-day work.
