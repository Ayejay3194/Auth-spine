ULTIMATE BUSINESS SPINE
======================

This is the "prevent hiccups" bundle: operations + admin + accounting + controls + incident response + launch gates.

What's included:
- Ops + Admin Master (policies, playbooks, onboarding, health panel spec)
- Accounting/QuickBooks surface area (ledger, invoicing, expenses, reconciliation, reporting)
- Dashboard spine (admin panel + feature flags + notifications)
- Reliability layer (launch gates, incident playbooks, runbooks, SLOs, backups, restore drills)

Use pattern:
1) Start every new company with this bundle.
2) Turn on modules via feature flags.
3) Never ship without passing the Launch Gate checklist.

Folders:
- /ops           operations, playbooks, SOPs
- /admin         rbac, approvals, feature flags, kill switches
- /finance       ledger, billing, payroll hooks, reporting, exports
- /reliability   monitoring, alerts, incident mgmt, backup/restore, change mgmt
- /templates     checklists, decision logs, postmortems
- /bundled-zips  originals that were combined into this master
