Defense-in-Depth Security Layer

Purpose:
Operationalize a full security checklist to prevent internal operations leakage.
This is not theory. These are enforceable controls, configs, and checklists.

How to use:
- Treat each folder as mandatory for production readiness
- CI should fail if required checks are missing
- External assistants must NEVER bypass these layers
