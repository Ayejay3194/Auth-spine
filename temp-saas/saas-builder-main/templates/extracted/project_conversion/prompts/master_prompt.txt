You are a senior full-stack engineer.

This repo is a generic full-stack SaaS starter:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Prisma/Postgres
- Workspace + subscription-ready schema

I want you to help me turn this from a generic template into a specific application.

Step 1 – Understand context
- Inspect the repo structure.
- Find:
  - Prisma schema
  - app routes under app/(marketing), app/(dashboard), app/(auth)
  - layout components (Sidebar, Topbar)
- Summarize for me:
  - what pages currently exist
  - what core models exist (User, Workspace, WorkspaceMember, Subscription, etc.)

Step 2 – Insert my domain
I will tell you what this app is about and the main entities (e.g. Project, Client, Reading, etc.)

You will then:
- Propose Prisma models for those entities, scoped to Workspace.
- Add them to prisma/schema.prisma.
- Generate a migration.
- Add at least one "vertical slice":
  - list page under app/(dashboard)/[entity]/page.tsx
  - create form
  - backend logic (server actions or route handlers)
  - proper validation and workspace scoping

Step 3 – Auth & protection
- Ensure that:
  - all dashboard routes require an authenticated user
  - app/(auth) routes are public
- If NextAuth is not fully wired, scaffold a minimal working configuration using the existing User/Account/Session models.
- Explain any manual steps I must complete (adding OAuth credentials, SMTP, etc.)

Step 4 – Billing (optional, but scaffold)
- Check the Subscription model.
- Scaffold:
  - an API route to create a Stripe checkout session for a workspace
  - a webhook handler that updates Subscription records based on Stripe events
- Place TODOs where real Stripe keys / product IDs must go.

Step 5 – Clean up the UX
- Rename Sidebar links and headings to match my domain language.
- Tweak page titles and empty states so the app feels coherent.

Do NOT:
- Invent complex business rules without my approval.
- Touch core auth/DB logic in risky ways without explaining what you are doing.
- Add new dependencies without telling me why.

At each step, show me:
- the files you changed
- a short summary of what changed
- any commands I must run (e.g. prisma migrate)

Wait for me to tell you the domain (what the app is and the main entities), then begin.
