# Choosing a Lane – Where To Point This Power

If you:

- Want stability and benefits → Job.
- Hate bosses and can talk to people → Freelance / Agency.
- Like building UI and patterns → Templates.
- Love solving specific problems deeply → SaaS.

Nothing stops you from trying all four over a few years.

Short version:
- First 3–6 months: learn and ship.
- Next 3–6 months: do 2–3 freelance projects or sell templates.
- After 6–12 months: try a small SaaS using the same stack.
