# Daily Rhythm – How To Actually Move Forward

Aim for 2 focused hours. No chaos tab-hopping.

## Daily Loop

1. **Plan (10–15 min)**
   - Open `TODO.md` or your issue list.
   - Choose 1–3 concrete tasks.

2. **Build (60–90 min)**
   - For each task:
     - If it's unclear, use GPT to shape it.
     - If it's big, use the pre-code + GLM + Claude flow.
     - Implement in small slices.

3. **Cleanup (15–20 min)**
   - Run the app.
   - Fix obvious errors.
   - Commit changes with a clear message.

4. **Log (5–10 min)**
   - Write in `DEVLOG.md` what you did and what broke.
   - This is audit + memory.

Small consistent days > occasional 10-hour chaos days.
