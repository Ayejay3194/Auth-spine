# 12-Month Arc – From Beginner to Dangerous

This is the macro plan if you stick with it for a year.

## Months 0–3
- Learn to run projects.
- Ship basic CRUD features.
- Get comfortable with Next.js + TS + Tailwind.

## Months 3–6
- Build 2–3 full mini-apps.
- Implement basic auth in at least one.
- Use AI flows (GPT → pre-code → GLM → Claude) on every feature.

## Months 6–9
Pick a lane:
- Job
- Freelance
- Templates
- Mini-SaaS

Focus on:
- Stability and speed.
- Cleaner architecture.
- Re-usable components and layouts.

## Months 9–12
- Build one "flagship" project:
  - multi-page app
  - clean UI
  - clear problem solved.
- Ship:
  - 1–3 templates OR
  - 1–2 small paid tools OR
  - serious job applications with your projects.

By month 12, you should:
- Have real repos to show.
- Be able to explain how you built them.
- Be dangerous enough to pivot into any of the money lanes.
