# Refactor, Cleanup, and Code Quality

Purpose:
Use code-focused models to continuously improve code quality without random rewrites.

Key patterns to enforce:

- Small, focused components.
- Hooks for shared logic.
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - UI vs data vs state.
- Consistent styling patterns.

The `prompts/refactor-cleanup.md` file contains prompt templates for:

- Refactoring a large component.
- Extracting a hook from duplicated logic.
- Converting inline CSS to Tailwind.
- Migrating ad-hoc JSX into consistent design-system components.
