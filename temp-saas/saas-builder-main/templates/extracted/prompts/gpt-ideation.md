# Prompt – Product & Feature Ideation (for GPT or similar)

You are a product strategist and senior frontend engineer.

I want to design or extend a web app.

Context:
- Domain: [describe]
- Target users: [describe]
- Primary goal: [describe]
- Tech stack: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, [DaisyUI/MUI/shadcn/ui], lucide-react.

Your tasks:

1. Ask me any missing clarifying questions first.
2. Propose:
   - A one-sentence product description.
   - 3–7 core user stories in "As a [user], I want..." form.
   - A list of key screens, each with:
     - purpose
     - main UI elements
     - important actions.
3. Suggest a minimal MVP scope:
   - what to ship in v1
   - what to explicitly defer.
4. Output:
   - "Product Summary"
   - "User Stories"
   - "Screens"
   - "MVP Scope"

Avoid implementation details at this stage. Focus on clarity and scope.
