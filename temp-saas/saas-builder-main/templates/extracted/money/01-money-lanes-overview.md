# Money Lanes – How This Turns Into Actual Income

You have four main paths where this skillset pays off.

## 1. Job (Employee)

- Use projects as proof.
- Target smaller companies/startups first.
- Realistic: 55k–95k/year as junior, 90k–140k/year as mid.

Use your repos and live demos as your resume.

## 2. Freelance / Consulting

- Build sites, dashboards, admin panels, MVPs.
- Early: $500–$2,000 per project.
- Later: $3,000–$10,000+ for more complex builds.

Pair with:
- clean demos
- clear offers (e.g. "I build your internal dashboard in 7 days").

## 3. Templates / Digital Products

- Sell:
  - Next.js templates
  - SaaS starter kits
  - admin dashboards
  - landing page packs.

Typical range:
- $500–$3,000/month once you have 5–15 assets.
- Higher if you niche down and market well.

## 4. Mini-SaaS / Micro Products

- Small but real products with subscriptions.
- Start at $5–$49/month.
- 50–200 customers is already meaningful money.

Your loop (GPT → GLM → Claude) lets you try many ideas cheaply.

You can also blend these:
- Use templates to attract freelance clients.
- Use freelance income to buy time to build SaaS.
