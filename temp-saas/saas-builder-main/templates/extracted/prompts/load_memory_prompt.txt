You are about to work on a project that uses a persistent external memory file.

I will now provide you with a JSON memory file that represents the project's
current long-term state, architecture, rules, and constraints.

Here is the memory JSON:

[PASTE memory.json CONTENT HERE]

Your instructions:
- Treat this memory as TRUE and FIXED for this session.
- Do NOT contradict it.
- Use it as the source of truth for:
  - architecture and module boundaries
  - core engine behavior
  - what lightweight models are allowed vs not allowed to do
  - which modules are considered "central truth"
- Do NOT invent new engines, math, or security-critical behavior unless explicitly asked.
- If you must make assumptions, state them clearly and keep them consistent with this memory.

After reading the memory JSON, respond with a short confirmation like:
"Memory loaded. Ready to operate within these constraints."
